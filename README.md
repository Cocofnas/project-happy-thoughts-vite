# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, I was able to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data my own database (which we set up a few weeks later).


### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We had a clear format to follow so the aim was more to follow the design as closely as possible, which is always harder than when you have your own design in mind. I had issues in the beginning with the data being fetched twice. For this project we used an API which for the first week was supplied for us but that we in one of the following week made ourselves. So this is the first fullstack project I made.
